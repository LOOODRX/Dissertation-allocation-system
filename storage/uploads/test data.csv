Controlling an infectious disease such as COVID-19 is an important, time-critical but difficult task. An infectious disease can be acquired by contact with infectious agents. Therefore, the health of each individual depends on the health of the people with whom he/she has close contact. This indicates the importance of informing people about the spread of the virus in their living and working environments. However, the accuracy and breadth of an optimal alert system are controversial. For instance, we can think of questions such as: Should people be informed if any of their neighbors got infected? Should we motivate people to take more care by falsely announcing higher infection rates in their area? In general, every alerting system faces a trade-off between the benefits of care and the disadvantages of fear. This project aims to study this trade-off and determine what alerts may be worth the feeling of insecurity they create. Using a standard modeling approach, we formulate the problem as an optimization problem and then solve it numerically by existing methods.",,farhadif@aston.ac.uk,[ Applied AI ] [ AI ] [ CS ],,"Strong undergraduate degree in computer science, engineering, mathematics or a related discipline as well as good analytical/mathematical skills.",1,,,Dr Farzaneh Farhadi,,"Game theory, Machine learning, Scientific computation, and Market design","How much privacy matters in a negotiation?
The focus of this project is on repeated negotiations in strategic settings where the parties lack information about each other‰Ûªs goals and incentives. Such settings are endemic in many negotiation contexts, from electronic commerce to diplomatic relations. Often, this lack of information about the participants‰Ûª underlying interests prevents the parties from reaching beneficial agreements, or from reaching agreements altogether. To date, evidence about the effect of information exchange on repeated negotiation is inconclusive: while it can lead to more equitable outcomes among the negotiation parties, it might also result in the exploitation of a vulnerable party. This project aims to study this trade-off and determine how much negotiators should be cautious about sharing their personal information to achieve the best result. This is a simulation project and requires good programming skills in at least one language (MATLAB, Python, etc.).",,a.j.stanton@aston.ac.uk,[ Applied AI ] [ AI ] [ CS ],,"Strong undergraduate degree in computer science, engineering, mathematics or a related discipline as well as good analytical/mathematical skills.",1,
