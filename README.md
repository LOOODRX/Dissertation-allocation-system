## Introduction

The MSc Dissertation Topic Allocation System is a web application designed to simplify and optimize the process of selecting dissertation topics for master's degree students. Utilizing information technology and data-driven algorithms, the system automates the allocation process, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.

### Objectives

The primary objective of this study is to design, develop, and implement an MSc Dissertation Topic Allocation System that aims to meet the following key requirements and objectives:

- **Enhance efficiency and transparency in the topic selection process**: Traditional topic selection processes rely on physical or electronic files, which may suffer from lack of transparency and inefficiencies. The system's primary goal is to improve the efficiency of the topic selection process, ensuring faculty can easily upload topics, students can quickly view and select topics of interest, thereby accelerating the entire topic selection workflow.
- **Optimize student preference matching**: By introducing mechanisms for students to express preferences, the system aims to optimize the topic assignment process. Students can rate each topic, ensuring better alignment with their needs and interests.
- **Provide online allocation functionality**: The system will offer online allocation capabilities, enabling supervisors or course administrators to efficiently assign topics based on student preferences, academic backgrounds, and other relevant factors. This helps ensure topics are matched with students' research interests and potential, thereby enhancing the quality of graduate dissertation projects.
- **Data management and analytics**: The system will collect and display data related to the topic allocation process. This data will assist academic institutions and administrators in real-time monitoring of topic allocation, enabling informed policies and decisions through data analysis, ultimately optimizing management of graduate dissertation topic selections.

By achieving these objectives, the MSc Dissertation Topic Selection System is expected to improve and simplify traditional topic selection processes, enhance institutional management efficiency, and provide superior academic resources and support, thereby advancing graduate education and research.
