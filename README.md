## Usage 

To get started with Amplication, the hosted version of the product can be used. You can get started immediately at [app.amplication.com](https://app.amplication.com). After the login page, you will be guided through creating your first service. The [website](https://amplication.com) provides an overview of the application, additional information on the product and guides can be found in the [docs](https://docs.amplication.com).

## Development

Alternatively, instead of using the hosted version of the product, Amplication can be run locally for code generation purposes or contributions - if so, please refer to our [contributing](#contributing_anchor) section.

Running Amplication
</summary> <br />

> **Note**
> It is also possible to start development with GitHub Codespaces, when navigating to `< > Code`, select `Codespaces` instead of `Local`. Click on either the `+`-sign or the `Create codespace on master`-button.

Amplication is using a monorepo architecture - powered by <a href="https://nx.dev">Nx Workspaces</a> - where multiple applications and libraries exist in a single repository. To setup a local development environment the following steps can be followed:

**BEFORE** you run the following steps make sure:
1. You have typescript installed locally on you machine ```npm install -g typescript```
2. You are using a supported node version (check `engines` `node` in the [package.json](./package.json))
3. You are using a supported npm version (check `engines` `npm` in the [package.json](./package.json))
4. You have `docker` installed and running on your machine


1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/amplication/amplication.git && cd amplication && npm install

2. Run the setup script, which takes care of installing dependencies, building packages, and setting up the workspace:
```shell
npm run setup:dev

3. Running the required infrastructure - view infrastructure component logs
```shell
npm run docker:dev

4. Apply database migrations
```shell
npm run db:migrate:deploy

5. To start developing, run one or more of the applications available under serve:[application] scripts of the package.json.
```shell
# running the server component
npm run serve:server

# running the client component
npm run serve:client

# running the data-service-generator component
npm run serve:dsg

# running the git-sync-manager component
npm run serve:git

# running the plugin-api component
npm run serve:plugins

Note
In order to run the Amplication client properly, both the client and server need to be started by the npm run serve:[application] command, as well as an additional component for development on a specific component.

The development environment should now be set up. Additional information on the different application components can be found under packages/[application]/README.md file. Happy hacking! ðŸ‘¾
